Overview “Deep Learning with PyTorch: Zero to GANs” is an online course intended to provide a codingﬁrst introduction to deep learning using the PyTorch framework. The course takes a hands-on coding-focused approach and will be taught using live interactive Jupyter notebooks, allowing students to follow along and experiment. Theoretical concepts will be explained in simple terms using code. Students will receive weekly assignments, work on a project with real-world datasets and participate in a private data science competition to test their skills.
